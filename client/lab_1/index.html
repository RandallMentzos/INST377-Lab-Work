        <h1>Randall Mentzos Lab 1: Intro to HTML</h1>
        
        <h2>First, the basics.</h2>
        
        You need the following to build your website.
        
        <ul>
            <li>HTML and CSS</li>
            <li>Javascript</li>
            <li>Node.js</li>
            <li>And other web development frameworks</li>
        </ul>

        You should list your top 5 albums below. This is to show you know how to use a list element.
        
        <ul>
            <li>Radiohead - Hail To The Thief</li>
            <li>Kendrick Lamar - To Pimp a Butterfly</li>
            <li>Death Cab For Cutie - Transatlanticism</li>
            <li>The National - Boxer (Live in Brussels)</li>
            <li>Kaki King - Dreaming of Revenge</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Let's Try Some Inline Elements</h2>
        
        Sometimes you want to draw attention to something in a line of text.
        
        Sometimes you want to strongly emphasize something in the text.
        
        Sometimes you want to do both.
        
        <h2>Empty Elements</h2>
        
        Soft line breaks can't wrap anything. Neither can image tags, or hard lines.
        Add a hard line under here, and make sure you've used some soft line breaks to match your page to the sample.
        
        <h2>Images </h2>
        Don't forget to use alt text on your images. It's important for accessibility.
